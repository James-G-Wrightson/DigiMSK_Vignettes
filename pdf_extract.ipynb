            "A 57-year-old man with insidious onset of progressive bilateral upper extremity weakness over approximately 1 year was referred to physical therapy by his primary care physician. Visual assessment of the patient revealed atrophy throughout the bilateral upper extremities, with an inability to reach the arms above shoulder height. Neurological exam findings revealed intact sensation, reflexes, cranial nerve function, coordination, and lower extremity strength. Babinski sign, clonus, and Hoffmann’s reflex were negative. The patient reported an absence of pain and demonstrated 2+/5 strength in the bilateral C5-T1 myotomes. Due to progressive bilateral weakness, the physical therapist referred the patient back to his primary care physician with a request for cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurology consultation. Differential diagnosis included cervical myelopathy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria recommend MRI in cases of myelopathy with slow, progressive symptoms. Upon return to his primary care physician, cervical radiographs were performed and neurology referral was placed. Cervical radiographs demonstrated multilevel degenerative changes ( FIGURE 1 ). Because the first available neurology appointment was not for 5 months, the physical therapist requested an expedited consultation. During the expedited neurology consultation, cervical spine MRI was SEAN MCINERNEY, PT , DPT , OCS, College of Applied Health Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL.

JIN SUH KIM, MD, MS, Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL.Cervical Myelopathy Presenting as Bilateral Upper Extremity Weakness performed, 3 months after the initial request from the physical therapist. Cervical spine MRI revealed compressive myelopathy at the C4-5 and C6-7 spinal segments, significant spinal canal stenosis, and severe spondylosis ( FIGURES 2 and 3). One week later, the patient underwent C4-C7 laminectomy, C3-C7 anterior cervical disc fusion, and C3-T2 posterior instrumentation. Following surgery, the patient was followed in outpatient physical therapy for 2 months without worsening of neurological status, but with no significant improvement in strength or use of upper extremities, perhaps due to the chronicity of the myelopathy.1 t J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(9):691. doi:10.2519/jospt.2017.7287 FIGURE 1.
